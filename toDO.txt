- Make the chart appear only when sorting algorithm is chosen
- The graph always stays but the choices change depending on the tab
    - Tab is highlighted

- The graph is in a container
    - Depending on the number of bars, the bar sizes change to fit the graph's container
    
- Graph Stays but the button to pick the sorting algorithm changes
- Animation on top has algorithm type that changes

- Slider to pick # of BARS (DONE)
    - Find max width of the screen size and make that the new max of the # of bars so it never overflows (FOUND MAX. NEED TO REDUCE AMOUNT IF SHRINKING PAGE)
    - Change the width of each bar depending on the number of bars rendered (DONE)
- Slider to pick length of time (DONE)





SORTING
- Can't change the speed during the middle of the algorithm
- Clicking generate new array during the middle of the algorithm should reset everything
